## FAQ

### ❓ Is this against Steam's terms of service?

Using this tool might violate Steam's terms of service. Use at your own risk.

### ❓ Will this get me VAC banned?

No, this tool doesn't modify any game files or interact with VAC-protected games in any way that would trigger a VAC ban.

### ❓ Do I need to have the games installed?

No, the application only tells Steam you're playing the games - it doesn't actually run them.

### ❓ Can I use this with multiple Steam accounts?

### ❓ Is my Steam password stored securely?

Your password is only stored if you enable the "Remember Password" option. It's stored locally on your computer in plain text, so only enable this option if your computer is secure.
